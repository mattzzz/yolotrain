# yolotrain

## entry for HackZurich 2019 - europe's largest hackathon

This project made the final and won the Siemens challenge.

I worked in a team with three others (Parni, Fubu, Mike)

I was responsible for the machine learning work and general direction of the project.

I used a mini version of yolo v3 to train the CNN, in a few hours, to recognise assets along train tracks for engineering maintenance. This was then to run in real-time processing images from a camera fixed on the front of a train.
